# Welcome to my website!

My name is Alexander Krammer. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student studying Biochemistry and Systems Biology at Case Western Reserve University.

I am currently applying to medical school and aspire to become a physician. In working towards that goal, I have spent a great deal of time volunteering at the Louis Stokes VA Medical Center and have engaged in research that is outlined in more detail on the "Projects" page. I have also spent a considerable amount of time engaged in leadership and other service activities, and will continue to work as the Senior Teaching Assistant for Organic Chemistry.

Please feel free to explore this site and [contact me via email](mailto:apkrammer01@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
