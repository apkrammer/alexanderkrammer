    "text": "BCO2 Structural Projects\nCurrently, I am working on two separate structural biochemistry projects in the Johannes von Lintig Lab. Both projects relate to the function of BCO2, an essential enzyme in carotenoid homeostasis.\n\nBCO2 Structural Determination\nBCO2 is a membrane-associated mitochondrial enzyme that is difficult to purify in a consistent and functional form. I developed a new protein purification protocol that relies extensively on micellar manipulation and an optimized affinity chromatography setup to substantially increase yield, purity, and stability of purified murine and human BCO2. This enabled various previous findings that I have presented or will present at national conferences.\nCurrently, working together with the Chakrapani Lab, we are attempting to determine an empirical structure of murine BCO2 using CryoEM.\n\n\nRational Enzyme Design\nPerhaps the most ambitious project I’ve worked on yet, my current aim here is to produce a broadly-specific synthetic CCD that will allow for the flexible production of particular carotenoid cleavage products. This work expands from a serendipitous discovery of a point mutation in BCO2 that results in the production of only the first cleaved carotenoid product. Working from predicted structural models and sequence alignments, along with a few key structural insights, my aims are to:\n\nIntroduce the substrate promiscuity of BCO2 into BCO1\nAlter key parts of the enzyme to shift substrate positioning in catalysis\nUltimately, produce a synthetic, adjustable CCD for specific apo-carotenoid production"

In working towards that goal, I have spent a great deal of time volunteering at the Louis Stokes VA Medical Center and have engaged in research that is outlined in more detail on the “Projects” page. I have also spent a considerable amount of time engaged in leadership and other service activities, and will continue to work as the Senior Teaching Assistant for Organic Chemistry.\nPlease feel free to explore this site and contact me via email if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."
